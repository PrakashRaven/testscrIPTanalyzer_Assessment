# Mentorship & Evaluation Call Notes

## Key points to communicate
- I designed and built the analyzer, created sample tests, and documented the workflow.
- Demonstrate a before/after example: show flagged `time.sleep` and refactored version using explicit waits.
- Explain how analyzer integrates into CI to prevent regressions.
- Highlight mentorship: created checklist and docs to onboard L1s to identify flaky tests.

## Example talking script
- "I automated static analysis to catch flaky patterns early, which reduced investigation time and improved CI reliability."
- "I mentored junior engineers by running code walkthroughs, reviewing their PRs, and providing fix templates."
